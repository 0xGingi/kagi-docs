## How do I set Kagi as my default search engine?

You can install a free browser extension or manually configure your browser to use Kagi Search. Check out our [documentation](setting-default.md) for details.

## Why does Kagi Search require an account?

Kagi Search requires an account only because it is a paid service which requires an account for the transaction.

Note that Kagi does not collect any personal information for billing and that you can even use an anonymous payment card such as PrivacyHQ if you want to.

## Why does Kagi Search require an email address?

We require an email address to be able to verify the account really belongs to you in the following cases:

- To handle the account recovery (in case you lose your password)
- In case you contact us via email with an account related questions (in particular requests to delete your account or change your subscription)

Note that you can use an anonymous email provider such as SimpleLogin with Kagi Search.

Kagi does need your personal information and the above requirements are just bare minimums needed in order to be able to operate a subscription business.

## I have privacy concerns over linking my search queries with my credit card. Why should I trust you?

We do not log search queries. Queries you type are never associated with your account. The simple reason is we don't have any reason to do so, as it would only be a liability for us. We are in the business of selling search results, not user data.

You can also check our [privacy policy](https://kagi.com/privacy) for more information.

## What data does Kagi collect?

Only bare necessities to run the service. Please see our [privacy policy](https://kagi.com/privacy) and our documentation about [privacy protection](../privacy/privacy-protection.md) for more information.

## How fast is Kagi Search?

We are...ahem...[fast](../search-details/search-speed.md).

## How do Kagi's features compare to other search engines?

Kagi has [key features](../why-kagi/kagi-vs-competition.md) you won't find in other search engines.

## How are searches counted?

- [Bangs](../features/bangs.md) and search suggestions (while typing) are never counted as searches.
- Reloading the same search within a short time (~2 minutes) does not count as an additional search.
- Each [lense](../features/lenses.md) and content type (e.g. images, news) is considered a separate search.

# Frequently Asked Questions from Pi Day Community Event

## Can you explain the pricing updates? 
We roleld out updates for our pricing plans on 3/15, the free plan has become a trial plan and we have introduced pay as you go as well to make Kagi more digestible. Our research shows that 99% of internet users search around 100 times per month so 200 should be more than ample for most of the internet. The majority of our users comprise the 1% of the users who search more than 100 times per month, and that is who the professional plan is targeting. The ultimate plan locks you into a discounted price as well as providing additional benefits as outlined on the [Ultimate Plan page](./plans/ultimate-plan.md). Unfortunately the pay as you go plans do not support annual because of the monthly pay as you go charges. In two weeks we will also launch the family plan. We have tweaked the pricing slightly since the initial blog post - we have reduced the price and increased the search pool. 

### Where is the "under one roof option?" 
We have removed the “under one roof option” . The intention is for up to 6 people to be able to share the family account. The family plan is also the ideal plan for those with kids who want to give them access to the web with the appropriate privacy and security and protections in place. 

### What about legacy plans?
Anyone on the old $10/month plan you will stay on that plan until renewal. Also introducing the early adopter professional plan available to anyone with an early adopter flag - this is $10 / month and offers 1,000 searches instead of 700 and will be automatically available to early adopters. The blog post is the most up to date information that we can provide.

### Why is Kagi focusing on AI and Orion Browser as well? 
Kagi has zero marketing budget and spends zero on marketing, we see Orion and AI as customer acquisition channels for Kagi. Orion is already providing about 20% of our customers, people find Orion first and then find out about Kagi. Instead of spending money on marketing we are spending money on the products because we want to holistically solve the problem of information on the web, not just search. There is a wonderful synergy between Orion and Kagi as well as the Universal Summarizer technology that we are investing in. Additionally 

### Why provided Metered Search? 
We investigated this for 3 months, we engaged the community in deep and detailed discussions. While this is not perfect and not as elegant as before we acknowledge this is the best way to provide search functionality to a large user base. There are people who search 100 times a month and some who search several thousand times per month and we needed a plan that makes it affordable to low searching customers and we don’t lose money on those who are in the 1% of search volume. 

## What functionality is the Universal Summarizer facilitating? 
Our Universal Summarizer technology provides us the ability to integrate powerful AI tooling:
* Summarize results on the page based on the query asked. 
* Individual page summaries for detailed analysis of a single page
* Asking the page questions, discussing the document as we call it in the UI so an individual can search through the document in a more meaningful and engaging way.

Kagi AI We started as an AI company in 2018, this is our roots, we are not a generative AI like ChatGPT3, this is in our DNA and the roots of our development. We would like to elaborate on this further, we are launching this functionality as a standalone app for Kagi users as well as a consumable API. Additional details are coming as we launch and Vlad has time to write the blog. Future functionality includes podcast summarization as well as hackernews discussion summarization. The greatest challenge is how to maintain this in Search while sticking to our mission of humanizing the web. 

## How do you balance development of AI features and Search?
Kagi is in the business of search, not in the business of selling AI, our philosophy is that AI is there to enhance the experience. We are excited by the possibilities that AI will bring - the initial demonstration shows the expansion of search backed by AI, for example the ability to chat with any document on the web. Currently only 10% of searches that can be made are actually being made, which is because current engines cannot cover the remaining 90%. For example, does Berlin have more people than Madrid is a question that any search engine can answer today. Another example is summarizing all the recent research on breast cancer. 

## Will you expose a Search API?
Now that we have billing infrastructure in place we can expose the API to personal accounts so that they can access the API. We are still working out how to charge for the API however this will be solved quickly given that we have metered abilities in place. 

## How do you rank results? 
We are weeding out the spam sites, our process is documented in our blogs, too much to summarize here but look at our blog for more information! 

## How do you guide users to reduce their costs and resource consumption?
We’ve done quite a bit to reduce the costs, for example we don’t charge for bang usage. Everything that is common sense and is at no cost to us we are open to keeping that as cost free for the users.

## How does Kagi reduce costs overall?
Our short term solution is to invest more in our infrastructure to reduce our overall costs, other providers increasing prices was a good wake up call. We are negotiating with a number of other search indexes that can help offset the costs. This is a long term work in progress, no deals have been signed, our goal is to stop using Bing by May 1st and have decent replacements in place without increasing our costs substantially. 

## How is Kagi Future Proofing itself?
It is very hard for any search startup to build an index of the web, it is not a matter of money even tho Bing spent 20 years and 20 Billion dollars and it is still not great. One of the most important areas to focus on is clickstream data, what people actually click - this is how Google is able to have better results. Even if crawl the entire web and try to rank results will still make misses. There is new legislation in the EU that will force big search engines like Google and Bing to share information such as click stream data. This is a path for smaller search engines to option information and really be able to create proprietary indexes. We are a small start up, we are okay relying on other technology for the meantime until the marketplace and technology is in a better place. 

## Does Kagi Need Funding? 
Our goal is to maintain as is, however we may do a family, friends and users financing round so that our users can invest in Kagi. This will be done in the April / May timeframe - there is a link to the form in our latest blog post.
