We have documentation that covers how to:
  - [Sign up for the Premium Plan](../plans/premium-plan.md#signing_up)
  - [Manage your billing](../plans/premium-plan.md#managing_billing)
  - [Cancel the Premium Plan](../plans/premium-plan.md#cancel_premium)

## Billing Settings: Pay Per Use 
The **Standard** and **Professional** plans both feature Pay Per Use options within the Billing Settings. Searches beyond the monthy included searches, are priced at 1.5 cents per search. There are two limts that you can set to control your cost:

* The soft limit triggers a notification regarding pay-per-use cost
* The hard limit prevents further searches so you do not incur additional costs.

## Billing Settings: Retry Billing
If your billing gets declined you will need to retry the billing attempt for the invoice by selecting the Manage Billing option under your Billing Settings 

## Billing Settings: Orion Support
If you are supporting the Orion Browser made by the same team that builds Kagi you will see the subscription listed at the bottom of the page with the option to cancel (tho we will work hard to make sure you do not!)

## Monthly Search Usage 
Toggling to this tab shows how many searches you've made over time and how that usage relates to any payments you've made.
