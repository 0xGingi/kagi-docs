# Profiles

With Orion Profiles, you can create multiple identities to be used online and keep all your Orion information separate, like bookmarks, history, passwords, extensions, and other settings.

To create new and manage existing profiles, Use the File -> Profiles menu. Every Orion installation comes with the Default profile.

Orion has complete isolation of Profile information at the app level. That means that Profiles will have their own separate:

- Settings
- Passwords
- Extensions
- Bookmarks
- History
- Sessions and website data

Moreover, Profiles in Orion appear as separate apps in your Dock. The app-level separation between profiles has multiple advantages, such as if one of your Profiles crashes, the others are left intact. 

Also, you can keep different profiles in your Dock and launch them with one click.
