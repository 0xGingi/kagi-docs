# Orion Web Extensions API support

Orion supports a growing number of Web Extensions APIs, and with them a growing nunber of btoh Chrome and Firefox extensions.

We maintain a list of officially supported APIs in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14IgSRVop4psUTgtLZlvYJYrAArhvL3WvRlUdzdQbIoQ/edit?usp=sharing).

Our goal is to eventually support 100% of APIs on Desktop and all APIs that are possible to support on iOS/iPadOS (due to Apple restrictions).
