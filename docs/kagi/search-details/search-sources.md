# Search Sources

We use heuristics and deep learning to understand query intent, select the best information sources, query them directly using APIs, and rank the results.

You can think of Kagi as a "search client," working like an email client that connects to various indexes and sources, including ours, to find relevant results and package them into a superior, secure, and privacy-respecting search experience.

Our searching includes anonymized API calls to traditional search indexes like Google and [Mojeek](https://mojeek.com), niche search engines like [Marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu) and vertical information sources like Wikipedia, Open Meteo, and other APIs. 

We also have our web index (internal name - Teclis) and news index (internal name - TinyGem).

Kagi's indexes provide unique results (available as an [API](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/enrich.html) too) that help you discover non-commercial websites and "small web" discussions surrounding a particular topic. 

For example, we [crawl recent blog posts of HN users](https://twitter.com/KagiHQ/status/1685376538852687873) and surface them in our results. Getting connected to other humans, often experts in their work areas, makes Kagi feel more humane to use than other search engines.
