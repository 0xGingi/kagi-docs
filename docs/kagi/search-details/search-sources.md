# Search Sources

We use heuristics and deep learning to understand query intent, select the best information sources, query them directly using APIs, and rank the results.

You can think of Kagi as a "search client," working like an email client, connecting to indexes and sources to find relevant results and package them into a superior, secure, and privacy-respecting search experience.

Our searching includes anonymized requests to traditional search indexes like Google and [Mojeek](https://mojeek.com), niche search engines like [Marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu) and vertical sources like Wikipedia, Open Meteo, and other APIs. 

We also have our own web index (internal name Teclis), news index (internal name TinyGem), and an AI for instant answers. Our unique results (available as an [API](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/enrich.html) too) help you discover non-commerical websites and "small web" discussions surrounding a particular topic. As an example we [crawl recent blog posts of HN users](https://twitter.com/KagiHQ/status/1685376538852687873) and surface them in our results. Getting connected to other humans, often experts in their areas of work, is what makes Kagi feel more humane to use than other search engines.
