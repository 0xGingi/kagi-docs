# Search Sources

We use heuristics and deep learning to understand query intent, select the best information sources, query them directly using APIs, and rank the results.

You can think of Kagi as a "search client," working like an email client that connects to various indexes and sources, including ours, to find relevant results and package them into a superior, secure, and privacy-respecting search experience, all happening automatically and in a split-second for you.

Our data includes anonymized API calls to traditional search indexes like Google and [Mojeek](https://mojeek.com), niche search engines like [Marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu), and vertical information sources like Apple, Wikipedia, Open Meteo, and other APIs. Typically every search query will bring in about dozen of different sources.

Even when you search for images in Kagi, we use seven different sources of information, trying to surface the very best image results for your query. We do a similar thing for Video/News/Podcasts results. 

But most importantly, we are known for our unique results, coming from our web index (internal name - Teclis) and news index (internal name - TinyGem). Kagi's indexes provide unique results that help you discover non-commercial websites and "small web" discussions surrounding a particular topic. Access to Teclis and TinyGem is available as an [API](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/enrich.html) too.

We are always trying new things and attempting to surface interesting, high-quality results. For example, we now [crawl blog posts of HN users and developers](https://twitter.com/KagiHQ/status/1685376538852687873) and surface them in our results. Getting connected to other humans, often experts in their work areas, makes Kagi feel more humane to use than other search engines.
