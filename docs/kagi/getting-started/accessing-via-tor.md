# Accessing via Tor

We are excited to announce that our search capabilities are now accessible through the Tor network! This guide provides a brief introduction to Tor, instructions on how to set it up, and details on accessing our service.


## What is Tor?

Tor (The Onion Router) is a privacy-focused network that enables anonymous communication by routing your internet traffic through a series of servers (nodes). It is widely used to enhance privacy and bypass censorship.
