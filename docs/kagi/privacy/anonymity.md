# Anonymity

At Kagi, your privacy is a priority, and we aim to provide the most user-friendly [privacy policy](https://kagi.com/privacy) of any search engine. However, it’s important to clarify that privacy and anonymity are not the same. While Kagi is designed to respect your privacy, achieving complete anonymity involves additional considerations.

We often get asked, "How can Kagi respect privacy if I need to log in?" This is because since Kagi is a paid service, an account is required for billing purposes. However, we’ve designed our system to collect as little information as possible.

Kagi has evolved to provide features for users who wish to maximize their anonymity even further:

- Anonymously authenticating using the [Privacy Pass](https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-privacy-pass) protocol
- Accessing our services via an official [Tor onion service](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/privacy/tor.html)
- You can use any email address to register including via solutions like [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/)
- You can also opt to pay via [cryptocurrency](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/plans/payment-methods.html#using-paypal-and-opennode-with-kagi)
- Coming soon: [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org) (XMR) payments will be accepted later this year. Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency designed to protect your financial privacy, and is used primarily for anonymous payments.

# Privacy Philosophy

Our relationship with you is simple: you pay for a service, and we deliver that service. We have zero need to monetize your data and, whenever possible, we choose not to collect or store user data, as it serves no purpose for us and only creates unnecessary risks. Respecting your privacy is also one of the reasons why Kagi is completely ad-free and tracking-free.

In summary, Kagi offers privacy by design and practical anonymity options for those who need them. While we continue to explore ways to improve, we believe Kagi already provides one of the most privacy-respecting search experiences available today.
