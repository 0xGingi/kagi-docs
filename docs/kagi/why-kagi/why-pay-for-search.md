# Why pay for search

Search advertising is becoming increasingly aggressive and harder to distinguish from organic results. In 2022 alone, [search advertising spending](https://www.statista.com/statistics/267056/paid-search-advertising-expenditure-worldwide/) reached a staggering **185.35 billion U.S. dollars** worldwide, and this is forecast to grow by six percent annually until 2028, hitting nearly **261 billion U.S. dollars**.

This explosion in spending has directly contributed to the cluttering of search results with intrusive ads, slowing down the experience and making it harder for users to find what they’re looking for.

Beyond just the clutter, these ads are powered by invasive tracking technologies that follow users across the web, exploiting their data to maximize ad revenue.

This is where Kagi comes in. By charging a nominal fee for searches, Kagi ensures that its search results are faster, more accurate, and completely respectful of the user's privacy:

And when you pay for search, you’re supporting a product that doesn't need ad revenue or access to user data because it gets its support directly from its users.

By aligning our incentives with those of our users, Kagi is committed to building a **better, more ethical web**.

## Ad-supported search engines & the future of the web

In the early days of Google, in 1998, its founders emphasized the importance of maintaining an ad-free search engine:

> "**The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users.** ...  **we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.**"
>
> — [The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf), Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, 1998

Unfortunately, this is exactly how it played out, and over the last 20 years we proceeded to witness the [great detoriation of web and search](https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over) as a result. In many ways, Google made a pivot from "organizing the world's information" to "organizing the world's ads" and we believe that this leads to a sub-optimal experience for the end user. 

This shift towards ad-driven models has fundamentally changed the nature of the web. Users no longer pay for services with money, but instead with their time, lost productivity, and even behavioral changes. Information is now mined for advertising purposes, compromising the quality of the content and the search experience itself.

**Google is only "free" if your time has no value.** Every ad, every clickbait result, every distraction costs the user time that could be spent more meaningfully, leaving the web cluttered with information designed to serve advertisers, not users.

## The numbers tell a tale

Ad based search engines make almost $300 a year off their users.

Google generated [$76 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/469821/google-annual-ad-revenue-usa/) in US ad revenue in 2023. Google had [274 million](https://www.statista.com/topics/1001/google/) unique visitors in the US as of February 2023.

To estimate the revenue per user, we can divide the 2023 US ad revenue by the 2023 number of users: $76 billion / 274 million = $277 revenue per user in the US or $23 USD per month, on average! That means there is someone, somewhere, a third party and a complete stranger, an advertiser, paying $23 per month for your searches.

## Kagi offers a choice

All search engines have search costs, development costs, and administrative costs. Most search engines cover this by advertising, tracking, and selling your data. And for 25 years we did not have any choice.

Kagi brings a new model to the market - pay for your search with your wallet instead. For only $5/mo (Starter plan) or $10/mo (unlimited search plan) you can now search with a peace of mind, knowing the results are always shown with your best interest in mind.
