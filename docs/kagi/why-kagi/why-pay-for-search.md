# Why Pay for Search

We'll let Google explain this (click to enlarge). This is the actual output from Google Bard AI tool.

## Ad-Supported Search Engines & The Future of the Web

We will let no other than the founders of Google explain this. The year is 1998, and this is how they describe why it is imperative for search engines to be ad-free:

> "Currently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. **The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users.** For example, in our prototype search engine one of the top results for cellular phone is "The Effect of Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention", a study which explains in great detail the distractions and risk associated with conversing on a cell phone while driving. This search result came up first because of its high importance as judged by the PageRank algorithm, an approximation of citation importance on the web [Page, 98].*
>
> It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers. For this type of reason and historical experience with other media [Bagdikian 83], we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers."

> — [The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf), Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, 1998

They were right in recognizing early on that ad-supported search engines will be biased towards the advertisers. They probably could not foresee how much damage to the web adopting the model they originally criticized would ultimately cause.

## Ad-Supported Search Engines & How You Currently Pay for Search

Recent reporting in [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/google-antitrust-lawsuit-search-results/) shed new light on how ad-supported search engines alter queries to generate more commercial outcomes.

> Google likely alters queries billions of times a day in trillions of different variations. Here’s how it works. Say you search for “children’s clothing.” Google converts it, without your knowledge, to a search for “NIKOLAI-brand kidswear,” making a behind-the-scenes substitution of your actual query with a different query that just happens to generate more money for the company, and will generate results you weren’t searching for at all. It’s not possible for you to opt out of the substitution. If you don’t get the results you want, and you try to refine your query, you are wasting your time. This is a twisted shopping mall you can’t escape.

For completeness, here is the official Google [response](https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1709726778170786297) to the article so you can decide for yourself.
 
One has to consider that the cost of ad-supported search is not free; you are paying with your time, attention and behavior change as well as personal information you are sharing and losing control of as you use ad-supported search.  

## The Numbers Tell a Tale

Ad based search engines make almost $300 a year off their users. 

Google generated [$76 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/469821/google-annual-ad-revenue-usa/) in US ad revenue in 2023. Google had [274 million](https://www.statista.com/topics/1001/google/) unique visitors in the US as of February 2023.

To estimate the revenue per user, we can divide the 2023 US ad revenue by the 2023 number of users: $76 billion / 274 million = $277 revenue per user in the US or $23 USD per month, on average! That means there is someone, somewhere, a third party and a complete stranger, an advertiser, paying $23 per month for your searches.

## Kagi Finally Offers a Choice

All search engines have search costs, development costs, and administrative costs. Most search engines cover this by advertising, tracking, and selling your data. And for 25 years we did not have any choice.

Kagi brings a new model to the market - pay for your search with your wallet instead. For only $5/mo (Starter plan) or $10/mo (unlimited search plan) you can now search with a peace of mind, knowing the results are always shown with your best interest in mind.
