# Contribute

The Kagi user community is a diverse and passionate group of people who help make Kagi better.

Here are a few ways you cna contribute:

- The easiest and most powerful way to contribute is to simply spread the word. Tell your friends, family and social circle about Kagi. Help set up Kagi for a few people in person. Send a [Kagi gift card](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/plans/gift-kagi.html) to a family member or friend for their birthday.
- Reprot bugs and post feature suggestions on [KagiFeedback.org](https://kagifeedback.org).
- Join or user community on [Kagi Discord](https://kagi.com/discord) and help others with questions.
- Contribute to Kagi documentation. Every page on this site is editable, just click the link on the bottom of the page and start chaning/adding more content. This will usually get merged the same day.
- Contribute to [translating Kagi](./contribute_translations.md) to other languages.
- Contribute to [Kagi open source projects](./open-source.md). We have many to pick from!
- Create [addons](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/community-addons/) for Kagi.


We often give contributors special perks, like preview of new features or get them involved with important decisions. For these perks make sure to be a part of our [Discord](https://kagi.com/discord).
