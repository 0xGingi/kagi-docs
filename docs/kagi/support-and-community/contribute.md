# Contribute

The Kagi user community is a diverse and passionate group of people who help make Kagi better.

- Help find bugs and post feature suggestions on [KagiFeedback.org](https://kagifeedback.org).
- Contribute to Kagi documentation. Every page here is editable, just click the link on the bottom of the page and start chaning/adding more content. This will usually get merged the same day.
- Contribute to [translating Kagi](./contribute_translations.md) to other languages.
- Contribute to [Kagi open source projects](./open-source.md). We have many to pick from!

If you plan on contributing, please join the [Kagi Search Discord server](https://kagi.com/discord) so we can coordinate.
