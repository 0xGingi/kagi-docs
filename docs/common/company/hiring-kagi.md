- Exceptional problem-solving and coding abilities.
- Crafting products with care

**Core Front-end Team**
- Passion for creating delightful and swift user interfaces.

- Demonstrable expertise with modern Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Experience in building noteworthy projects utilizing machine learning.

## Part-time opportunities

**Kagi R&D Team**

We are deeply committed to fostering a culture of research and development (R&D) at Kagi. Many of our groundbreaking technologies such as the [Universal Summarizer](https://kagi.com/summarizer), [FastGPT](https://kagi.com/fastgpt) or [Small Web](https://kagi.com/smallweb) have their origins in our R&D initiatives. At any time we have 4-5 individuals working on R&D projects, with some eventually transitioning to full-time roles.

We are currently seeking full-stack developers who embody the following qualifications:

- Proficiency in backend development with Python, Ruby, or Node.js, paired with expertise in crafting frontend interfaces using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Ability to dedicate 10-20 hours per week to R&D projects.
- A proactive and self-organized working style, capable of thriving in a "fire & forget" mode.
- A passion for building innovative projects from the ground up.
- You can demonstrate a history of tinkering with product ideas/hacking projects together.

If you are eager to contribute to cutting-edge projects and grow with a dynamic team, we would be thrilled to hear from you.
